    <h1>Hi, I’m Sydney 👋</h1>
    <p class="intro">I’m a curious builder of systems and stories — with a scientific mind and a poetic soul. I bring together backgrounds in Information Science, Computer Science, and UX Research to craft human-centered digital tools.</p>

    <h2>✨ About Me</h2>
    <p>I studied at Cornell and King’s College London. My work explores the intersection between thoughtful design and technical systems, with experience spanning HCI, data analytics, and digital product development.</p>
    <p>Beyond the screen, I love capturing still moments with a camera, getting lost in concerts and café corners, and creating things that speak to both heart and logic.</p>
    <p>I’m open to opportunities across UX research/design, data science/analysis, and software engineering — roles where I can bridge users and systems, and contribute with both empathy and logic. My interdisciplinary background gives me the flexibility to work across product development, 
        from user needs to data insights to technical execution.</p>
    <p>I’m especially excited by roles that value cross-functional thinking, and where I can grow into a thoughtful builder of digital tools — grounded in user empathy and supported by data and code.</p>

    <h2>🌏 Why I Do What I Do</h2>
    <p>I believe that good design is not only functional but empathetic. I care deeply about inclusion, access, and clarity — and I build with the hope that technology can bridge worlds, not widen them.</p>
